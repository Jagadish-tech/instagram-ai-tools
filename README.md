While I can't create a visual "front page" for your GitHub project, I can provide the creative and descriptive text elements you can use for the repository's main page (the README.md file). A great front page for your repository should be informative and engaging, acting as a welcome for anyone who visits.

Here are the creative front page elements for your "Instagram AI Tools" GitHub repository:

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/instagram-ai-tools.git](https://github.com/your-username/instagram-ai-tools.git)
cd instagram-ai-tools
````

### 2\. Set Up the Backend

The backend is used for the spam detection simulation.

```bash
cd backend_folder # assuming you place the server.js file in a backend folder
npm install
npm start
```

*Note: The frontend code in `nani.html` makes direct calls to the Google Gemini API, so you'll need to set up your API key within the JavaScript file for the generative features to work.*

### 3\. Open the Frontend

Simply open the `nani.html` file in your web browser to access the tools.
